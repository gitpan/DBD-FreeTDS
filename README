This is a sneak peek of a DBD module for Microsoft SQLServer and
Sybase.  It is in the very early stages of development and many parts
of it are not implemented yet.

The main advantage of this driver is that it directly speaks the raw
TDS protocol and does not need any third party libraries.  For more
information about TDS see the FreeTDS web page at

   http://sunsite.unc.edu/freetds/

The current source code may be obtained via anonymous ftp at 

   ftp://freetds.internetcds.com/pub/freetds_dbd/

Status as of February 17, 1999-
   * $dbh->login, $dbh->do are implemented.
   
   * $dbh->prepare is partially implemented.  (Placeholders are not 
     implemented yet.)

   * $dbh->{} is implemented for setting some attributes, but not for 
     fetching them.

   * $sth->execute is implemented and can handle multiple result sets 
     and COMPUTE columns.

   * $sth->fetchrow, $sth->fetch_hashref are implemented for most of the 
     server datatypes.
   
   * $sth->finish is implemented.
  
   * $sth->{} will fetch the attributes 'NAME', 'NUM_OF_FIELDS', 
     and 'more_results'.  ('more_results' is for handling multiple
     result sets returned from a single query.)
