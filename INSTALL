WARNING- This driver is very much ALPHA software.  It is missing
functionality as well as robustness.  Use at your own risk.

Before installing this driver you must install perl5 (obviously) and
the DBI module.  You may get the DBI module from

   http://www.perl.com/CPAN

Once you have both of those installed (and tested) just cd into the
freetds_dbd directory and type-

   make
   make test
   make install     

The Makefile.PL is geared towards building the driver for development,
not for production use.  It defaults to building a static perl with
memory leak checking turned on.  

If you want this for production use (see the warning above) you will
want to turn off memory leak detection and you will probably want
shared libaries.  Simply remove -DTRACE_ALLOCMEMORY_LEAKS from the
$cflags variable and change $LINKTYPE to 'dynamic'.


As of February 10, 1999 the driver fails 12 out of 45 tests.
